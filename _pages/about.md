## About Me
My name is Bruno Corsino and I live in Lisbon, Portugal.
I am an Azure Administrator and I spend most of my days building solutions.


## My Cloud Journey
I started my journey in the cloud 4 years ago by doing a Cloud Identity Academy promoted by Microsoft Portugal. 

I joined **Microsoft Identity Team** a few months later as a Support Engineer.

Almost 2y passed, I decided to leave Microsoft to become an Azure Consultant. Since then I have worked and advised customers by using the best practices in the cloud.
